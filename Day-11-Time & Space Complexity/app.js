{
  Time Complexity
  it is used to measure efficiency of alogrithem in terms of speed , as the input size grows. 

  ### Big notation 
  we will measure the time Complexity used in the wrost case or
  repersent wrost case time Complexity.

  linear search -----> O(n)
  Binary search -----> O(log n)

  ### what is the notation ?
  it is just symbol nothing more then that.
