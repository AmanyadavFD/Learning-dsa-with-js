# ðŸš€ Learning DSA with JavaScript

This repository is part of my journey to **master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using JavaScript.  
Every day, I solve programming problems â€” starting from the basics and gradually moving to advanced topics â€” while documenting my learnings.

## ðŸ“… Daily Progress

### âœ… Day 1 â€“ Programming 101

- Learned how to write and run basic JavaScript programs.
- Covered **variables**, **data types**, and **basic operations**.
- ðŸ“‚ Folder: `Day-1-Programming-101`

---

### âœ… Day 2 â€“ Functions & If-Else

- Practiced writing **functions** and using `if-else` control flow.
- Solved problems using **conditional logic** and **function abstraction**.
- ðŸ“‚ Folder: `Day-2-Function-if-else`

---

### âœ… Day 3 â€“ Loops 01

- Practiced `for` and `while` loops.
- Solved problems like:
  - Printing numbers
  - Checking even/odd

---

### âœ… Day 4 â€“ Loops 02

- Solved problems combining loops, functions, and arrays:
  - Search Element
  - Count Negative Numbers
  - Find Largest Number

---

### âœ… Day 5 â€“ Second Largest Number

- Problem: **Find the Second Largest Number in an Array**

---

### âœ… Day 6 â€“ Loop in Loop

- Learned about **nested loops** (loop inside a loop).
- Solved two-level nested loop problems.

---

### âœ… Day 7 â€“ Pattern Printing with Nested Loops

- Practiced **nested loops** by printing:
  - Star patterns (`*`)
  - Number patterns
  - Increasing & decreasing triangles
  - Left & right-aligned pyramids

---

### âœ… Day 8â€“11 â€“ Number Manipulation & Complexity Basics

**Problems Solved:**

- **Count Digit** â€“ Count digits in a number efficiently.
- **Palindrome Number** â€“ Check if a number reads the same backwards.
- **Reverse Integer** â€“ Reverse an integer, handling negatives & edge cases.
- **Time & Space Complexity** â€“ Revised complexity analysis for optimized solutions.

**Key Learnings:**

- Using `%` (modulus) and `/` (division) for digit extraction.
- Looping techniques for number manipulation.
- Edge case handling for negative numbers & large values.
- Importance of **Time Complexity** & **Space Complexity**.

**Small Wins:**

- Reduced code length while keeping clarity.
- Practiced dry-running code to debug faster.

### âœ… Day 12â€“13 â€“ Arrays (Easy/Medium)

- **Remove Duplicates** â€“ Remove repeated elements in-place.
- **Remove Element** â€“ Remove all occurrences of a given value in-place.

### âœ… Day 14 â€“ Arrays (Easy/Medium)

- **Reverse String** -Reverse String elements in-place.

### âœ… Day 15 â€“ Arrays (Easy/Medium)

- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks**

### Day 18 -
